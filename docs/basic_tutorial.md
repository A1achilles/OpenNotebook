# Basic OpenNotebook worksheet creation tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn to create a simple worksheet with 
OpenNotebook, a free and Open Source application for designing
math materials. In this tutorial we will be creating a worksheet
for students to practice drawing and interpreting linear graphs. 

To download the application go [here] (http://jaltekruse.github.io/OpenNotebook/ "here"), 
it requires an up to date install of [Java] (https://java.com/download/ "Java").

To begin, you'll add a graph to your document. Find the button on the bottom
toolbar that looks like a grid. Click on it and you will see a little
number "1" appear on the button. This allows you to place a single graph
on the document, try clicking and dragging on the document to place
your graph. If you want to place several graphs, you can click the button
twice and you will see a little lock. While the lock is shown, any time you
click and drag on the document it will add a new graph. To get rid of the 
lock after you are done placing graphs, just click the button again.

If you make a change you want to revert, use the orange and green arrows on
the top menu bar for undo/redo. Use undo/redo, or the trash can to get rid
of all of the graphs but one. The lock feature to create multiple objects
is useful in some cases, but here you'll want the graphs to be the same size/shape
to make the document look professional. We'll cover better ways to do that below.

Next you can make sure your grid is square so it will be easy to align after we copy it.
To accomplish this we are going to use the window that popped up when
you added your graph. This will pop up any time you add a new element to your
document, or click on an existing one to select it.

Look at the buttons on this menu to find the one with a black square on it.
Click the button to make the height and width of your graph equal.

Now let's actually graph an equation on your grid. On the menu for the graph
click on the text box under the label "Expressions". Here you can simply provide
the right hand side of the equation you wand graphed, the application will add
y= for you. If you want to graph more than one equation on a single graph, click
the "Add new" button.

Now that you have a good template for each problem, a square grid with one or more
equation graphed on it, let's make some copies to fill up your document. We will edit
each of the copies to turn them into different problems. To copy, select your grid and use
the button on the top toolbar for copying, next to the sissors and clipboard for cut and
paste respectively. Note that as you create grids that the text box for writing an equation
is focused, this can throw off the standard keyboard shortcuts. This allows you to easily edit
the euation being graphed as soon as you add a grid, but it can cause some confusion.

After creating a few copies of your grid, arrange them into approximately the arrangement
you would them to have in the final version, don't worry about lining them up yet. To
move more than one grid at a time you can select them in a group by clicking and dragging
on the document.

If you want to include a line that is outside of the default view of the grid, use
the arrows and magnifying glass buttons on the grid to adjust what is shown.
