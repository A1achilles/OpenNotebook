Unlike other tools,\r\nOpenNotebook is designed specifically to work with mathematical content, in a manner that is\r\napproachable by non-technical users. Many tools exist for programmers and mathematicians, \r\nLatex is a favorite among these audiences, and tools like MS Word provide some basic functionality \r\nto edit equations, but nothing is available to allow for the creation of complete professional \r\nmathematical materials without a steep learning curve.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making documents for print, Open Notebook provides tools to make your worksheets\r\ninteractive. The student mode of Open Notebook allows for the assignments to be completed \r\ndigitally including showing their step-by-step algebra work. We will be working to integrate\r\nthese documents with popular course management systems like Moodle to enable efficient collection\r\nand automated grading of the digital assignments. This will enable teachers to promptly and \r\neasily analyze their students' performance on each assignment to identify trouble spots and \r\nbetter prepare for class the next day.\r\n\r\nTo enable reuse of materials, OpenNotebook also includes facilities to create not only static\r\ncontent, but problem formulas that will let you generate new versions of a worksheet. With these\r\npowerful tools, we hope to empower teachers to build a world class library of open educational materials\r\nand provide all of the benefits of digital mathematics to every classroom, absolutely free.\r\n\r\nYour future of a more productive school day, and more time to spend helping your students \r\nawaits.
