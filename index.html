<p>Open Notebook enables math teachers to create documents like worksheets, tests and quizzes easily.
It includes native tools for adding rich mathematical content like graphs, equations, number lines and
geometric models with ease. It is released completely free of charge under the GPL Open Source license.
Many tools exist for programmers and mathematicians, 
Latex is a favorite among these audiences, and tools like MS Word provide some basic functionality 
to edit equations. Unfortunately nothing has available to allow for the creation of complete professional 
mathematical materials without a steep learning curve, until now.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>Open Notebook runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. It requires an up to date version of Java (Sorry chromebook users, we're working on a java-free solution, check back for updates!).</p>

<h3>Contact the Team</h3>
<p>We love to hear from users, and we are looking for advocates to share Open Notebook with their colleagues. If you think this software could help the teachers at your school, please reach out for a FREE demo and training session over a skype or google hangout call. You can also contact us if you are interested in being a part of our community, to write new features and fix bugs,  or if you aren't a programmer you can help us document or test the software.</p>

<p>In addition to making documents for print, Open Notebook provides tools to make your worksheets
interactive. The student mode of Open Notebook allows for the assignments to be completed 
digitally including showing their step-by-step algebra work. We will be working to integrate
these documents with popular course management systems like Moodle to enable efficient collection
and automated grading of the digital assignments. This will enable teachers to promptly and 
easily analyze their students' performance on each assignment to identify trouble spots and 
better prepare for class the next day.</p>

<p>To enable reuse of materials, OpenNotebook also includes facilities to create not only static
content, but problem formulas that will let you generate new versions of a worksheet. With these
powerful tools, we hope to empower teachers to build a world class library of open educational materials
and provide all of the benefits of digital mathematics to every classroom, absolutely free.</p>

<p>Your future of a more productive school day, and more time to spend helping your students 
awaits. <a href="http://jaltekruse.github.io/OpenNotebook/OpenNotebook_0.1.jar">Try Open Notebook now!</a></p>


<h3>Request Features or Report Bugs</h3>
<p>This software is still under heavy development. We will try to fix bugs reported promptly
and maintain backwards compatibility as we improve the software with new features, but the software
comes with no guarantees. If you experience problems, or have feature requests, please report them on Github
<a href="https://github.com/jaltekruse/OpenNotebook/issues">here</a>.</p>
