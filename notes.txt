Results from Moodle install - look back at this:
Server checks
Name    Information     Report  Plugin  Status
php_extension   xmlrpc  should be installed and enabled for best results

The xmlrpc extension is needed for hub communication, and useful for web services and Moodle networking
        Check
php_setting     opcache.enable  PHP setting should be changed.

PHP opcode caching improves performance and lowers memory requirements, OPcache extension is recommended and fully supported.

        - may be in sites-available/000-default.conf instead

Tasks:
    - implement simple text file based "student overview" page
        - students upload text docs with single answer in it
            - skipped this, instead implemented grading with student work for a single
              problem on a single OpenNotebook page
        - figure out how to kick off something at the time when submission is over to
          aggregate the answers that were incorrect
            - going to have teachers just pull down all student work, all grading,
              automatic an manual will happen on their machine in the java app
            - no need to duplicate parsing or doc in-memory structure in PHP, or
              require admins to install Java on the server
    - xml parsing in php, look for elements with an "answer" field
        - allow for teachers to get up the list of expected answers somehow
        - compare answers against each solution in each student doc, aggregate incorrect work
        - write incorrect work to a file, with link to student ID and problem number, anything
          needed to talk to moodle to push partial credit back to the site
        - decided against this, see above
    - enhance OpenNotebook to layout the "Overview page" on launch
        - does not open on launch, but there is a new button now which allows loading a zip file
          full of docs and correctly generates the teacher overview page

After looking at a lot of Moodle APIs, this might be easiest to just do in JAVA, where the structures to parse
and traverse documents are already implemented
	- I had thought it would need to be in php to make it easier for the teachers to do the automatic grading
	- Moodle didn't seem to have a good place for me to store the answer key
	- all of the automated grading stuff implemented today is based on their quiz structure
		- it looks fairly powerful, but doesn't seem like the best fit, I don't want to force teachers to
		  create problem sets in a Web UI
		- they can just assign problems out of the book and this should still be useful
		- I could even grade the student's work against each other, look for most common solutions
			- I don't even have to know if they are right, I can just show them to the teacher, they
			  can compare them to the answer key and assign a score for common answers
			- these can be automatically applied to all students who had that answer
			- with extra work done by the teacher to more thoroughly evaluate incorrect work for
			  partial credit
	- Moodle has a feature to download a zip file full of student submissions
	- and submit back an edited version of the same files
	- I can just modify the application to be a viewer of all of the files, I can dynamically
	  show different subsets of the work
		- just manually graded problems
		- most troublesome problems
		- show all work (even the correct work)
	- will need to have a way for a teacher to associate an answer key with the files for grading
		- open answer key
		- add button "Grade Student Submissions"
			- tooltip - Use current document as an answer key to grade a zip file full of student work
	- after generating worksheet
		- add a new feature to explode it into a "digital version"
		- remove answers from doc
		- split up to one problem per page so that we can clearly identify what student work belongs with
		  a particular problem
	- during uploaded of the new zip file with feedback
		- make sure I have a way of representing scores, including partial credit in each doc
		- open the zip, read the score for each student and store it in the gradebook while the existing
		  code saves it back as the binary file the student can look at to see all of their feedback

TODOs:
    - fix package names, currently in root namespace
    - set up maven build
        - anticipating adding new depedencies soon, will want to make these easy to manage
    - unit tests for existing features
        - look at the list of test stubs that were checked in recently
    - refactor existing code to make use of the new visitors
        - will allow for re-evaluation of various places where during iteration of a doc
          we want to recurse down into sub-objects in groupings or not and consolidate
          some code in these areas
        - can simplify some code where it should be clear if a traversal is going to
          modify the incoming document or just look for something or calculate some aggregate
          information across all of the pages and objects
    - move mouse handling code to a better abstraction to make it more reasonable to understand
      what code blocks consume the event and how the event handling for various cases is ordered
        - the blocks for each type of event, mouse-click, mouse-up, etc. should only be a few lines
          to define the ordering of the various handlers that may end up consuming the event
    - refactor attributes to be kept in Maps rather than vectors, if possible remove knowledge
      of a given attributes name from the attribute itself and only have a name be managed by
      whatever is holding onto it
        - do a similiar refactoring with NamedObjectList
    - generate output zip full of student docs
    - generate CSV with final grades (the sum of automatically graded and manually given scores)
    - write plugin for Moodle to allow parsing the grade CSV file and update gradebook appropriately
    - write tests for moodle plugin to ensure students get their feedback docs and gradebook is updated
    - grading UI improvements
        - apply grade given manually to other similar answers
            - with a popup? maybe a setting that can be turned on by default
        - group objects by similar answers or work
        - provide a side panel to see all of the answers for the problem currently being graded
    - student UI improvements
        - allow students to specify problem numbers
            - Use scott's code to parse an assignent description and fill in problem numbers automatically
        - allow pages to have different sizes, students can expand to make workspace for a problem larger
    - implement grading without an answer key
    - implement better interface for creating and editing answer keys
        - at the very least make the ordering based on how they are visually given, rather than
          the meaningless order they appear in the data structure
        - making the data-structure order could possibly allow for auto-tabbing to the next available
          object that can be filled in, based on how things are layed out visually
            - not sure how to handle rows vs. columns, how can I know how things are arranged?
            - this was something that came up in interface testing with users, so it would be
              good to think about
            - once student was able to understand how to solve problems through the UI, they wanted
              to just use their keyboard to move through the assignment

- Work starting at 8:15
- develop test plan
- Areas to test
    - All objects
        - serDe
        - setting properties and constraints
        - manipulation actions (caused by buttons, should be pretty well separated from front-end)
    - Document manipulation
        - add/remove pages
        - cut/copy/paste
        - layer management
        - add/delete objects
        - Mouse actions
            - separate math and doc manipulation from mouse handler
        - undo/redo
            - separate this state from front-end
    - Problem generation
    - Grading
    - Printing
- First things to test
    - Already wrote tests for basic doc and object serialization/deserialization
    - probably makes sense to start testing the smallest units possible
        - attribute classes and their constraints
            - trying to test constraints for setters
            - constraints are not actually being enforced for the value settting methods
              just the ones that parse the values from a string
                - should refactor to change this, see if the app still functions okay
                - would be nice to encapsulate behavior when code not in a path that can prompt
                  a user for a different value
                    - examples, auto-correct corrupt files
                    - snapping to an edge when dragging an something around and the mouse 
                      goes out of the allowed area
                    - are there cases where the correction/snapping needs to happen at a level
                      higher than management of a single property and constraints, does
                      the object that contains the attribute need to manage this?

-----------------
4/20/2016
-----------------
- modify attribute classes to enforce constraints in their setter methods
  instead of just when read from strings
    - time estimate 20 mins, finish 9:40
    - this caused issues with mouse handling
    - didn't take notes the day I worked on this, but tracking the values that would
      be generated by the mouse movement (and possibly produce a negative height/width/position)
      outside of the objects and applying correction logic so an invalid value would never be set
      into the object fixed the problem
        - are there other places where this correction needs to take place?
            - should this be a part of attributes or the object themselves?
            - some restrictions need to span across individual attributes, so they
              would need to appear at some higher level

-----------------
4/29/2016
-----------------
- things to work on moving forward
    - implement features explored in the javascript rewrite of the application to 
      the java one
        - particularly around teacher grading expereince
    - should I remove features?
        - once users are actually downloading I need to support most or all of the
          features I "ship"
        - If I want to maintain problem generation, I should probably make it an
          add-on and clearly convey that it is experimental
            - are there other features I can cut to limit the scope?
    - actually go through to at least remove UI for features that I cannot support right away
        - and remove them from the docs
            - user tutorial and readme/homepage

-----------------
5/7/2016
-----------------
- Work starting at 10pm
	- Need some direction for the project
	- still not sure if it makes sense to pursue Java version or
	  new javascript based application
		- For now I'll split my efforts and see which one gets
		  me to a good outcome first
		- I'm still more productive in Java, but I'd like to work
		  on getting to know the javascript tool set
- Doing some product design
	- As I said above, I need to remove features from the Java version
	  and make sure that the core experience is really good
	- Review core teacher and student experiences
- Teacher experience
	- assigning homework
		- teachers can use Open Notebook to design static documents
		  with problems, quizzes, activities, etc.
		- problem generation will be removed for the first version
		- teachers can also just provide their students with an
		  assignment out of a book or website, to be completed in
		  their digital notebook
	- grading work
		- teachers will use their own service/infrastructure to collect
		  assignments
			- I will assume they can get the assignments together in a
			  folder or zip file themselves
			  	- I know moodle uses zip files to manage multiple documents
			  	- I assume blackboard, d2l and similar services also use
			  	  zip files to download a bunch of studet assignments, might
			  	  want to confirm but they must have some manner of handling
			  	  docs in bulk
		- teachers can obviously just open the student documents to view them
		  individually
		  	- they will see the same interface as a student opening the doc
		  	  to continue their work
		  	- no interface will be provided to grade an individual doc
		  		- except putting a single doc into the grading feature
		- on the application, teachers can also choose to open a list of student
		  docs to grade them together
		  	- for now, assume they will not have an answer key
		  	-
