Open Notebook enables math teachers to create documents like worksheets, tests and quizzes easily. 
It includes native tools for adding rich mathematical content like graphs, equations, number 
lines and geometric models with ease. Many tools exist for programmers and mathematicians, 
Latex is a favorite among these audiences, and tools like MS Word provide some basic 
functionality to edit equations. Unfortunately nothing has available to allow for the 
creation of complete professional mathematical materials without a steep learning 
curve, until now.

In addition to making documents for print, Open Notebook provides tools to make your worksheets
interactive. The student mode of Open Notebook allows for the assignments to be completed 
digitally including showing their step-by-step algebra work. We will be working to integrate
these documents with popular course management systems like Moodle to enable efficient collection
and automated grading of the digital assignments. This will enable teachers to promptly and 
easily analyze their students' performance on each assignment to identify trouble spots and 
better prepare for class the next day.

To enable reuse of materials, OpenNotebook also includes facilities to create not only static
content, but problem formulas that will let you generate new versions of a worksheet. With these
powerful tools, we hope to empower teachers to build a world class library of open educational materials
and provide all of the benefits of digital mathematics to every classroom, absolutely free.

Your future of a more productive school day, and more time to spend helping your students 
awaits. [Try Open Notebook now!](http://jaltekruse.github.io/OpenNotebook/OpenNotebook_0.1.jar)
